# 3D-Ball-game
[ There were some problems in uploading files, I'll add that soon, for now you can download and play the game from my Dropbox:

It's a simple 3d game
The exe file is the file, which you need to run to play the game.
and the data also should be there in the same folder.
So download both file and start playing <3

I know there are too much bugs, I'll try to improve these when I get some free time. It is a simple 3D game project for one of my varsity courses. Thank you All.

Waiting to know your high Score in the pro level :D 
Mine was 28, and my younger brother did 38 :D

Good luck.
